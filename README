Testerman Quick Start

Run the Testerman Agent Controller:
./tacs.sh
By default, it won't daemonize for now.

Then run the Testerman Server:
./ts.sh
By default, it won't daemonize for now.

Run a basic agent, for instance with one probe automatically deployed:
./pyagent.sh --deploy tcp01=transport.tcp


Use the CLI client for minimal tests:
export TESTERMAN_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
./testerman.sh status
