Minimal Requirements
====================

1. Server-side:
- Linux (some non-portable code will prevent the server from running
  on other systems for now: Tools.kill*()) (untested under other OSes for now)
- Python 2.4+ (tested with 2.5, 2.6)
- libxml2-python (debian:python-libxml2 and dependencies)

2. Client-side (QTesterman):
- Python 2.4+ (tested with 2.5+)
- Qt 4.4.1+ with PyQt bindings (debian:python-qt4 and dependencies)
- QScintilla2 for python (debian:python-qscintilla2 and dependencies)
- Tested under Ubuntu 8.10, 9.04, 9.10, OpenSUSE 11.1,
  Windows XP SP2, Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1, Windows 7
  and should run on any systems with a Python 2.4+ available.


Optional Requirements
=====================

1. For development
- requirements above
- pyrcc4 (included in debian:pyqt4-dev-tools)

2. For probes
- depends on the probe. Please see http://www.testerman.fr/

3. For QTesterman default plugins
- xslt: xslt1 and xml2 for python (debian:{python-libxslt1 ,python-libxml2} and dependencies,
  all included in libxml2 package for Windows))


Testerman first run for the impatient
=====================================

1. Configure a document root (docroot):
   Edit conf/testerman.conf and set document_root to a directory that will contain
   Testerman user scripts. It does not need to exist, but must be rw for the user
   you'll use to start the server.
   
   The default is ~/testerman.

2. Set up the document root:
   admin/testerman-admin.py -t . setup document-root

3. Start the Testerman server components:
   admin/testerman-admin.py -t . start all

4. Check if everything is running:
   admin/testerman-admin.py -t . status

5. Start an agent (not mandatory, but required for
   samples execution):
    from the source root: ./pyagent.sh --name localhost

6. Start the QTesterman client:
    from the source root: ./qtesterman.sh

7. Enter http://localhost:8080 as the server URL,
   use anything you wish as username (for instance 'guest')

8. Browse the "remote repository" to access the samples/
   and open "testerman.ats".
   Run it. All tests should be OK.
   Play with other samples on will.
   Give feedbacks.


Summary/sample (using the default docroot in ~/testerman):

admin/testerman-admin.py -t . setup document-root
admin/testerman-admin.py -t . start all
./pyagent.sh --name localhost # use -d to daemonize if you prefer
./qtesterman.sh
