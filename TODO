Core features / non-TTCN3:
==========================

- testerman nodes:
ability to install a 'testerman container' on any machine that connects to a controller
(as an agent connects to the TACS) that will be available to execute PTCs on demand.
Enables PTC distribution on multiple machines, both for feature testing (PTC simulating
endpoints behind a NAT gateway, etc) and performance (scalability, simulating endpoints
from N IP addresses, etc).
This is the TTCN-3/Test System Executor CH (Component Handler) part.

- support for codec aliases: DONE
ability to configure codec properties, and set an alias to reference such a configured codec.
For instance, an XML codec instance may have a "encode-headers" properties,
other may have default behaviour (http version in a http.* codec used for encoding), etc.
Could be useful to switch codec implementations easily, too.
For instance, "map" may refer "map.phase2", "map.phase1", etc.

- code cleanup around local/remote probes: DONE
Locally-implemented probes can be used as is by a pyagent, rendering them
distribuable immediately.
This implies these probes are implemented in Python, and are run using the
same Python interpreter as the TE.

If you have technical constraints (other Python interpreter to use, such
as Jython, Python for .NET, IronPython, or another implementation language),
you can still implement remote probes only, based on the agent of your choice.
In this case, you also have the possibility to develop "Remote Probe Stubs",
which act as interceptors between the TE and the TACS, where you can perform
low-level messages translations, or include some Python code in your implementation
(the implemention is then split over the stub and the probe on your agent).

Selection of remote or local probe implementation instances are only based on 
the bound probe URI (probe:name for local ones, probe:name@agent for remote).


- campaign management

Core features / TTCN3:
======================

- interleave ?

Codecs:
=======

- BER codec, with plugin support to support things like TCAP, MAP, INAP

Probes:
=======

- Enhanced HTTP probe, really based on urllib or httplib so that transfer-encoding, redirect, etc are correctly managed
- M3UA probe
- LDAP probe
- SQL probe (mysql (DONE), posgresql, oracle (DONE), informix)
- SIP probe ? (current workaround: UDP + SIP codec)

QTesterman:
===========

- modify the visual viewer so that it (mostly) matches TTCN-3 graphical representations
- implement encoded message views in the log viewer
