This module is from Noah Spurrier's pexpect library 2.3.

Please see LICENSE and README files for credits.

However, the 'examples' directory has not been included,
and minor modifications were applied to match testerman's needs,
rendering the module not as general purpose as the original 
one was.
As a consequence, you should not reuse this library if you need pexpect,
but download the original one from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/
instead.
