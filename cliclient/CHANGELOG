Testerman CLI Client Changelog

0.2.0:
- Added support for session parameters:
  you may use --session-filename FILENAME to pass
  a conf-like file containing KEY=value lines (# to comment a line) 
  to pass initial session parameters to a job.
  Additionally, you may override or provide values using
  --session-parameters KEY=value[,KEY=value]*
  All key names and values should be provided in utf-8.
	
KNOWN BUG:
- when passing a session parameter value containing spaces with
  --session-parameters, only the first word is taken into account.
  Values with spaces work correctly from a session file, however.

0.1.1:
- Added support for campaign log expansion.
  When getting a log file with --get-log, you may use an
  additional --expand-logs flag to follow <include> log elements and
  perform an inline expansion of the included log files.
  The resulting log file then contains all the execution traces.

0.1.0:
- First really usable version.
