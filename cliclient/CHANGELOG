Testerman CLI Client Changelog


KNOWN BUGS:

- when passing a session parameter value containing spaces with
  --session-parameters, only the first word is taken into account.
  Values with spaces work correctly from a session file, however.


REVISION HISTORY:

0.3.0:
- Added: support for testerman package (.tpk) execution
- Added: --run <uri> replaces all the --run-{local-,}-{ats,campaign} command
  line options. However, these options are still available for compatibility.
  The job source uri has a 'local' or 'repository' scheme. The path extension
  determines the job type (.ats: ats, .campaign: campaign, .tpk: package):

  local:/local/path/to/ats.ats
  local:/local/path/to/campaign.campaign
  local:/local/path/to/package.tpk
  
  repository:/repository-path/to/ats.ats
  repository:/repository-path/to/campaign.campaign
  repository:/repository-path/to/package (no extension for repository package)

- Modified: inline help has been reorganized.


0.2.1:
- Fixed a regression preventing running scripts
  when no session-parameters were provided.


0.2.0:
- Added support for session parameters:
  you may use --session-filename FILENAME to pass
  a conf-like file containing KEY=value lines (# to comment a line) 
  to pass initial session parameters to a job.
  Additionally, you may override or provide values using
  --session-parameters KEY=value[,KEY=value]*
  All key names and values should be provided in utf-8.
	

0.1.1:
- Added support for campaign log expansion.
  When getting a log file with --get-log, you may use an
  additional --expand-logs flag to follow <include> log elements and
  perform an inline expansion of the included log files.
  The resulting log file then contains all the execution traces.


0.1.0:
- First really usable version.
