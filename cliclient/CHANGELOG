Testerman CLI Client Changelog

0.1.1:
- Added support for campaign log expansion.
  When getting a log file with --get-log, you may use an
  additional --expand-logs flag to follow <include> log elements and
  perform an inline expansion of the included log files.
  The resulting log file then contains all the execution traces.

0.1.0:
- First really usable version.
