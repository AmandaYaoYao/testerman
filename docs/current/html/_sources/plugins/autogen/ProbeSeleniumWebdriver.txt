Overview
--------

This probe enables Testerman to perform Selenium-based tests through the Selenium Webdriver using a standalone Selenium Server.

The probe automatically starts the browser on the host as soon as it is mapped, and everything is cleaned up once the test case is over.

A basic example is available in ``samples/selenium_webdriver.ats``.

Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All platforms.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The probe needs a configured (and running) Selenium Server that it can reach (depending on the browser, you may need different servers).[[BR]]
You may install it on the host you want to run the browsers from.
