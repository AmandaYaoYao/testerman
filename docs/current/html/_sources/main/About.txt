Welcome to Testerman
====================

Testerman is an attempt to produce a TTCN-3 inspired test automation system without the strict typing
model of the TTCN-3 test control notation that can be too heavy to be practical with non-stricly defined
protocols. This is achieved by bringing TTCN-3 primitives and concepts to the Python programming language.

It provides a complete environment to design, manage, execute and analyze automated tests,
and can be used as a platform to develop test simulators (drivers and stubs) and prototypes of network applications.

Unlike existing tools specialized in a single or a single kind of protocol support
(such as "web services", "GUI testing", "GSM", etc), Testerman focuses on providing all the
necessary base to perform end-to-end, system testing of network-based applications mixing multiple protocols.
In particular, it was designed with telecom platforms in mind, such as VoIP/IMS based ones.

Testerman also turns out to be a way to develop equipment simulators that could be used to automate interop testing.
For instance, we may imagine some endpoint manufacturers developing simulators in Testerman,
and making them available to test them with another vendor's call control platform.

About
=====

Testerman was initially developed by Sebastien Lefevre, a software
engineer employed at the time by a telecommunications equipment
provider.

Fed up with the over-priced, proprietary or
never-as-integrated-as-needed end-to-end testing tools, he decided to
develop his own and give it back to the community he learned so much
from.

Let's hope you'll enjoy using Testerman as much as he did while
developing it !
