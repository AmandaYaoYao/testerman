About
=====

Testerman was initially developed by Sebastien Lefevre, a software
engineer employed at the time by a telecommunications equipment
provider.

Fed up with the over-priced, proprietary or
never-as-integrated-as-needed end-to-end testing tools, he decided to
develop his own and give it back to the community he learned so much
from.

Let's hope you'll enjoy using Testerman as much as he did while
developing it !
