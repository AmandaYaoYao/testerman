This is QTesterman, a PyQt4-based GUI for Testerman.
================================================================================

1.1.99:
- Added: preferences support to enable/disable code autocompletion
  (experimental - now disabled by default)
- Added: scheduled run and rescheduling support
- Added: support for documentation plugins; a sample (template-based)
  "testcase specification extractor" plugin is provided to extract static info
  from ATS (useful when writing test cases directly in Testerman, and still
  enabling test specs review by peers)
- Added: syntax check when saving a module. You cannot save a module
  that contains syntax errors; this avoids breaking ATSes due to simple
  errors such as typos.
- Added: campaign log support. The log viewer now displays testcases
  in an ATS tree and can follow 'include' elements in campaign logs.
  When saving raw logs, an option is available to expand these included
  logs inline.
- Added: online mode support for standalone log viewer.
  When using -l with --online, the login dialog pops up so that a
  server can be selected for included logs retrieval.
- Added: log-reporter plugin interface: added getModel() to retrieve
  the current loaded log model for deferred (non-realtime) reporting
- Added: simple/sample template-based reporter. Same principle as the
  test specification extractor, using (almost) Velocity-compliant templates,
  and testcase docstring @tag support.
- Added: logs window (in Tools menu), displaying internal QTesterman logs.
  May be useful for troubleshooting and bug submissions when running in pure
  windows (no console) mode.
- Added: support for SUT address for system sent/received events in
  both visual (as a tooltip) and textual viewers.
- Modified: native epydoc-based documentation generator is now a plugin
- Modified: main window layout capabilities; left-side docks can now use
  full height. Should be more convenient for the remote browsers when
  used in low screen resolution (1024x768).
- Modified: "Resource generator" plugin renamed to "Resource importer", as
  it is used to import files as embedded resources, not to generate them
- Fixed: several log analysis speed improvements, up to 33% faster
- Fixed: reloading of a file that contained non-ascii characters did not work
- Fixed: loading and reloading of local files under Windows, including
  log files when using the --log <file> command line option
- Fixed: ATSes in "cancelling" state can now be killed if needed
- Fixed: campaigns document, in remote browser, now have a execution and
  revisions sub-nodes


1.1.0:
- Added: experimental outline view, very basic, incomplete, doomed to evolve
- Added: basic chat component, single channel
- Added: server status indicator, with fast server switching
- Added: previous option in search/replace dialog
- Added: support for manual check for updates in Preferences dialog
- Added: support for file deletion in the remote browser
- Added: support for campaign execution and associated job monitoring.
  However, no logs or analyzer are available for them now (not yet).
- Modified: improved remote browser, with asynchronous loading
- Modified: improved visual log viewer, with TTCN-3 GFT-like symbols
- Modified: improved settings dialog, renamed to "Preferences"
- Fixed: more consistent GUI guidelines, in particular regarding layouts
- Fixed: saving raw logs to a file generated incorrectly utf-8 encoded xml.


1.0.1:
- Added: auto-update support, with self restart
- Added: support for initial session parameters (ATS run parameters)
- Modified: qtesterman.py is now the main launcher, and should be used in
  user shortcuts.


1.0.0:
- First release, based on a major contribution by Comverse - Netcentrex Converged IP Communications.
