This is QTesterman, a PyQt4-based GUI for Testerman.
================================================================================

1.1.99:
- Added: preferences support to enable/disable code autocompletion
  (experimental - now disabled by default)
- Added: scheduled run and rescheduling support
- Added: support for documentation plugins; a sample "test specification extrator"
  plugin is provided to extract static info from ATS (useful when writing
  test cases directly in testerman, and still enabling test specs peer-review)
- Added: syntax check when saving a module. You cannot save a module
  that contains syntax errors; this avoids breaking ATSes due to simple
  errors such as typos.
- Modified: native epydoc-based documentation generator is now a plugin
- Fixed: reloading of a file that contained non-ascii characters did not work
- Fixed: loading and reloading of local files under Windows, including
  log files when using the --log <file> command line option.

TODO:
- sutAddress display and message encoding display in log analyzer(s)
- a default html- or text-based reporter as a sample reporter plugin
- campaign log support

1.1.0:
- Added: experimental outline view, very basic, incomplete, doomed to evolve
- Added: basic chat component, single channel
- Added: server status indicator, with fast server switching
- Added: previous option in search/replace dialog
- Added: support for manual check for updates in Preferences dialog
- Added: support for file deletion in the remote browser
- Added: support for campaign execution and associated job monitoring.
  However, no logs or analyzer are available for them now (not yet).
- Modified: improved remote browser, with asynchronous loading
- Modified: improved visual log viewer, with TTCN-3 GFT-like symbols
- Modified: improved settings dialog, renamed to "Preferences"
- Fixed: more consistent GUI guidelines, in particular regarding layouts
- Fixed: saving raw logs to a file generated incorrectly utf-8 encoded xml.


1.0.1:
- Added: auto-update support, with self restart
- Added: support for initial session parameters (ATS run parameters)
- Modified: qtesterman.py is now the main launcher, and should be used in
  user shortcuts.


1.0.0:
- First release, based on a major contribution by Comverse - Netcentrex Converged IP Communications.
