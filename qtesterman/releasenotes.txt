This is QTesterman, a PyQt4-based Ritch Client for Testerman.
=============================================================

KNOWN BUGS:
- Profiles management is minimal for now: no way to delete/rename one,
  and it is not possible to remove parameters in a profile.
- The script properties editor does not reselect the parameter you just
  updated.
- Saving a campaign log with the "expand" option does not work as expected.


1.3.0-svn:
- Added: ability to close tabs with the middle mouse button.
- Added: preliminary support for script-associated profiles.
- Added: "save local copy" action.
- Added: "open log file" action.
- Added: support for script parameter's types (boolean, integer, float, string).
- Added: support for script "language API" to enable the use of alternative
  TTCN-3 librairies.
- Added: it is now possible to paste copied script parameters to a spreadsheet
  or any text application.
- Added: double-click on a tab to maximize it to full window.
- Added: support for testcase groups selection
- Modified: finally a dedicated Testerman icon !
- Modified: the job manager now displays more recent jobs on the top.
  For a campaign, however, older child jobs are displayed at the bottom.
- Fixed: inverted zoom in editor when using the mouse wheel.
- Fixed: when opening a deleted log from the job manager, the log window
  does not show up anymore.
- Fixed: "save to repository" dialog box now starts from the current document's
  path (if it was saved into the repository before).
- Fixed: root files in the repository are now monitored correctly.
- Fixed: crash when updating the log viewer once the log file has been deleted.



1.2.1:
- Fixed: 100% usage and real-time interface not working under
  Microsoft Windows.


1.2.0:
- Added: preferences support to enable/disable code autocompletion
  (experimental - now disabled by default)
- Added: scheduled run and rescheduling support
- Added: support for documentation plugins; a sample (template-based)
  "testcase specification extractor" plugin is provided to extract static info
  from ATS (useful when writing test cases directly in Testerman, and still
  enabling test specs review by peers)
- Added: syntax check when saving a module. You cannot save a module
  that contains syntax errors; this avoids breaking ATSes due to simple
  errors such as typos.
- Added: campaign log support. The log viewer now displays testcases
  in an ATS tree and can follow 'include' elements in campaign logs.
  When saving raw logs, an option is available to expand these included
  logs inline.
- Added: online mode support for standalone log viewer.
  When using -l with --online, the login dialog pops up so that a
  server can be selected for included logs retrieval.
- Added: log-reporter plugin interface: added getModel() to retrieve
  the current loaded log model for deferred (non-realtime) reporting
- Added: simple/sample template-based reporter. Same principle as the
  test specification extractor, using (almost) Velocity-compliant templates,
  and testcase docstring @tag support.
- Added: logs window (in Tools menu), displaying internal QTesterman logs.
  May be useful for troubleshooting and bug submissions when running in pure
  windows (no console) mode.
- Added: support for SUT address for system sent/received events in
  both visual (as a tooltip) and textual viewers.
- Added: file rename option in Remote browser (use F2 to edit the name).
  The extension is automatically kept if not provided.
- Added: support for file and folder copy in Remote browser. Only
  interfaced via Drag and Drop.
- Added: editor colors can now be modified from the Preferences dialog
- Added: the remote browsers now monitors remote file system changes.
  They are updated when items are created/deleted/renamed.
- Modified: "save to repository as" now displays a browser-based
  file selector.
- Modified: native epydoc-based documentation generator is now a plugin
- Modified: main window layout capabilities; left-side docks can now use
  full height. Should be more convenient for the remote browsers when
  used in low screen resolution (1024x768).
- Modified: "Resource generator" plugin renamed to "Resource importer", as
  it is used to import files as embedded resources, not to generate them
- Modified: several cosmetic changes
- Fixed: several log analysis speed improvements, up to 33% faster
- Fixed: reloading of a file that contained non-ascii characters did not work
- Fixed: loading and reloading of local files under Windows, including
  log files when using the --log <file> command line option
- Fixed: ATSes in "cancelling" state can now be killed if needed
- Fixed: campaigns document, in remote browser, now have a execution and
  revisions sub-nodes
- Fixed: regression from 1.0.0: under Windows, was unable to open
  local files.


1.1.0:
- Added: experimental outline view, very basic, incomplete, doomed to evolve
- Added: basic chat component, single channel
- Added: server status indicator, with fast server switching
- Added: previous option in search/replace dialog
- Added: support for manual check for updates in Preferences dialog
- Added: support for file deletion in the remote browser
- Added: support for campaign execution and associated job monitoring.
  However, no logs or analyzer are available for them now (not yet).
- Modified: improved remote browser, with asynchronous loading
- Modified: improved visual log viewer, with TTCN-3 GFT-like symbols
- Modified: improved settings dialog, renamed to "Preferences"
- Fixed: more consistent GUI guidelines, in particular regarding layouts
- Fixed: saving raw logs to a file generated incorrectly utf-8 encoded xml.


1.0.1:
- Added: auto-update support, with self restart
- Added: support for initial session parameters (ATS run parameters)
- Modified: qtesterman.py is now the main launcher, and should be used in
  user shortcuts.


1.0.0:
- First release, based on a major contribution by
  Comverse - Netcentrex Converged IP Communications.
